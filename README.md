  <strong> ðŸŽµ A NextJS/React lyrics translator app designed to work with Spotify Desktop ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽµ </strong>

  **Check out <a href="https://github.com/sglkc/moegi">Moegi Spotify Web Extension made by @sglkc</a>** (Credits for the original idea & design inspiration)

  This app communicates with Spotify Desktop through the **Spotify Web Playback SDK**, more native OS-level extension possibilities compared to the Chrome extension for the Spotify Web Player, which primarily modifies CSS.

### **Why build this?**

This project was built primarily for **educational purposes** and to explore additional functionalities that could be extended into:
- **Audio reactions**
- **AI-driven lyrics analysis**
- **Community insights** (e.g., integration with **Genius**)

The app should be portable to **Mac, Linux**, and **mobile devices**, although these platforms haven't been tested yet.

---

### Current Issues (v0.1):
- **Japanese Romanization** is incomplete due to the complexity of Kanji.
- **Language settings** have not yet been implemented.

---

### Setup Instructions

To set up this app, youâ€™ll need both **Google Translate API** and **Spotify Developer** credentials.

#### 1. **Google Translate API**
- Create a **Google Cloud developer account** and generate your API key.
  
  *Note*: The Google Translate API is **not free**. If you're looking for alternatives, check out [google-translate-api-x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-translate-api-x).

```
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=...(Set up here: https://cloud.google.com/apis)
```
2. Spotify Developer Account
Set up your [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) account and obtain your client secret.
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=... (Set up here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
```

Your final `.env` would look something like this for local development:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=...
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=...
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=...
```

Iâ€™m exploring ways to make this app more accessible to users, as most cloud-based solutions incur costs. Some ideas for future development include:
 - Running everything locally, reducing dependency on cloud services (except for Spotify interaction), i.e.
 - Local LLM for translation ([GPT4ALL](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all))
 - Local transcription AI (e.g. [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/) or finetune Whisper, if there is a reliable way to somehow extract only the vocals out)
   
 Alternatively, I could consider hosting a server with some advertisements, as long as this complies with license agreements. The current integration with the Musixmatch API poses challenges, as access to it is difficult to obtain.

### Credits

A big thank you to [Lyrix by BlueCatSoftware](https://github.com/BlueCatSoftware/Lyrix) for providing the lyrics through Musixmatch.

Also, thanks to sglkc's [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/sglkc/moegi) for the inspiration behind this project.
