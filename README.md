  <strong> ðŸŽµ A NextJS/React lyrics translator app designed to work with Spotify Desktop ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽµ </strong>

  **Check out <a href="https://github.com/sglkc/moegi">Moegi Spotify Web Extension made by @sglkc</a>** (Credits for the original idea & design inspiration)

  This app communicates with Spotify Desktop through the **Spotify Web Playback SDK**, more native OS-level extension possibilities compared to the Chrome extension for the Spotify Web Player, which primarily modifies CSS.

  <br />

### **Why build this?**

This project was built primarily for **educational purposes** and to explore additional functionalities that could be extended into:
- **Audio reactions**
- **AI-driven lyrics analysis**
- **Community insights** (e.g., integration with **Genius**)

The app should be portable to **Mac, Linux**, and **mobile devices**, although these platforms haven't been tested yet.

  <br />

### Current Issues (v0.1):
- **Japanese Romanization** is incomplete due to the complexity of Kanji.
- **Language settings** have not yet been implemented.

  <br />

### Setup Instructions


1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/in-c0/spotify-lyrics-translator.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Set up <a href="#how-to-set-up-environment-variables">Environment Variables</a>
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=...
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=...
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=...
```
4. Run the development server
```
npm run dev
```

### How To Set Up Environment Variables

To set up this app, youâ€™ll need both **Google Translate API** and **Spotify Developer** credentials. 
If you are developing locally, create a new file in the root project directory named `.env.local`. (Do NOT share your API keys/Secret or commit the file!)

#### 1. **Google Translate API**
- Create a **Google Cloud developer account** and generate your API key.
  
  *Note*: The Google Translate API is **not free**. If you're looking for alternatives, check out [google-translate-api-x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-translate-api-x).

```
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=...(Set up here: https://cloud.google.com/apis)
```

#### 2. Spotify Developer Account
Set up your [Spotify Developer](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) account and obtain your client secret.
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=... (Set up here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
```

Your final `.env` would look something like this for local development:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=...
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=...
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=...
```

Iâ€™m exploring ways to make this app more accessible to users, as most cloud-based solutions incur costs. Some ideas for future development include:
 - Running everything locally, reducing dependency on cloud services (except for Spotify interaction), i.e.
 - Local LLM for translation ([GPT4ALL](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all))
 - Local transcription AI (e.g. [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/) or finetune Whisper, if there is a reliable way to somehow extract only the vocals out)
   
(... or I could host a server with a couple of ads, as long as it aligns with the license agreements... It probably won't in the current state given the Musixmatch API being difficult to obtain.)
